    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1998 in the heart of Oregon, Codyâ€™s Cable started as a small family-run cable TV operation. Cody himself, a former line technician, wanted to bring better options to neighborhoods that the big providers ignored. Over the years, we've grown into a regional provider known for personalized service, fast response times, and transparent pricing.</p>
